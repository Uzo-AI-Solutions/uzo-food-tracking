-- Fix RLS policies to allow service role key access
-- Changes TO authenticated â†’ TO public to enable service role bypass
-- Service role automatically bypasses RLS (PostgreSQL security model)
-- Authenticated users still only see their own data (auth.uid() = user_id check)

-- Drop existing policies with TO authenticated restriction
